# Hello-Github
This is just a test repository made to learn about github.
I am just a newbie who recently got my intrest into coding, computer security and other things related to computing.
that includes shell schripting and other CLI activities and different types of hacking.
that's why I am intrested in github, the greatest open-source platform for coding and shareing of codes with both small and professional developers.And some big companies too.
